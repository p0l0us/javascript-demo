# Player project template.

See const folder for media sources.

Expected steps:
- Load json file to a variable
- Display data as simple media list
- Modify to use Redux or MobX
- Create few unit tests
- Setup player to run non-drm and drm playback (hardcoded items allowed)
- Integrate player with media list.
